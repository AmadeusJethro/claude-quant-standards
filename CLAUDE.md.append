## Quant Standards

When working on trading/backtest code:
- Shift signals by 1 before position calc (lookahead bias)
- Use Decimal for money, never float
- Flag suspicious results: Sharpe > 2, win rate > 65%
- Required tests: lookahead, costs impact, param stability
- Log experiments to docs/EXPERIMENTS.md
