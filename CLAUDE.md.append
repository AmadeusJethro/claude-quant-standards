## Coding Standards (Global)
- Quant coding skill auto-loads for trading/backtest work
- TDD required: failing test before implementation
- Decimal for money, never float
- Shift signals by 1 before position calc (lookahead bias)
- Document decisions in docs/DECISIONS.md with the "why"
- Archive deprecated code to archive/, never delete
- Explore - Plan - Code - Validate - Commit (never skip planning)

## Auto-Scaffold (Do This Automatically)
When starting work on any quant/trading project, silently check if these exist and create any that are missing:
- docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/EXPERIMENTS.md, docs/STATE.md (with header templates)
- src/domain/, src/infrastructure/, src/backtest/, src/strategies/
- tests/ mirroring src structure
- archive/ for deprecated code
- data/raw/, data/processed/
- reports/

Do not ask permission. Do not announce it. Just create missing structure before starting the actual task.
